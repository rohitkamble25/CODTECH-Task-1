QUIZ GAME IN C:

Project Overview:

Overview:
This project is a simple console-based Quiz Game implemented in the C programming language.
The game is designed to test the player's knowledge on various topics by asking a series of multiple-choice questions. 
The player earns points for each correct answer, and the total score is displayed at the end of the game.

Purpose and Objectives:
The main purpose of the Quiz Game is to create an engaging and educational tool that can be used for testing knowledge in a game format. It serves as a practical example of how basic C programming concepts can be applied to create interactive applications. The specific objectives of the project include:

Educational Tool: Provide an entertaining way to learn and test knowledge on various topics.

Project Scope
This project includes:

Multiple Choice Questions: A set of pre-defined questions with four answer options each.
Score Tracking: A scoring system that keeps track of correct answers and displays the final score at the end of the game.
User-Friendly Interface: A simple text-based interface that guides the user through the game.


Features
1.Multiple-choice Questions: The game offers a variety of questions, each with four possible answers.
The questions can cover a wide range of topics, making the game both fun and educational.

2.Scoring System: The game features a scoring system that rewards players for correct answers.
The score is calculated based on the number of correct responses, and the final score is displayed at the end of the quiz.

3.Modular Code Design: The game is structured in a modular way, with separate functions handling different parts of the game, such as displaying questions, checking answers, and calculating scores. 
This makes the code easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

4.Input Validation: The game includes basic input validation to ensure that the player's inputs are within the expected range (e.g., entering a valid number corresponding to one of the multiple-choice answers).

5.Replayability: After completing the quiz, the player is given the option to play again or exit the game.
This feature encourages repeated playthroughs, allowing players to improve their sco


How to Play:

1)Start the Game: Run the program in a terminal or command prompt.
2)Answer Questions: For each question, type the number corresponding to your chosen answer and press Enter.
3)View Score: At the end of the quiz, your total score will be displayed.
4)Replay or Exit: Choose whether to play another round or exit the game.

Technical Details
programming Language: C
Input/Output: The game uses standard input and output functions to interact with the player.
Control Structures: The program uses loops and conditional statements to control the flow of the game.
Data Handling: The questions and answers are stored in arrays or structs, depending on the implementation, for efficient access and modification.


Integration with Other Projects
The Quiz Game could be integrated into larger educational platforms or learning management systems (LMS). For example:

Educational Apps: Integrate the quiz game into educational apps as a feature for testing knowledge on various subjects.

Classroom Tools: Use the quiz game in classroom settings, where teachers can input custom questions related to their lessons.

Online Learning: Incorporate the quiz game into online learning platforms, allowing users to take quizzes as part of their learning modules.
